Diet Plan Cost Optimization using Octave Programming<br />

## 1 Introduction
Food is one of humanity's essential but maintaining a healthy diet is a problem.

Communities that lack access to inexpensive nutrient-rich food can benefit from practical solutions offered through diet optimization.​

It has prompt researchers to use ML techniques to help optimize diets and lessen the cost of nutritious food.

## 2 Problem Statement
Maintaining a healthy diet is challenging for many individuals due to budget.
Cost of healthy food items can be expensive which is why people tend to go for cheaper but less nutritious alternatives.
Machine learning algorithms and numerical optimization can help in optimizing diets: <br />
- feasible to pinpoint affordable substitutes for costly yet widely popular food<br />
- foster wholesome eating habits while reducing costs.<br />

## 3 Objective
- To identify the right numerical optimization techniques for diet cost optimization.<br />
- To examine the constraints and limitations associated with diet cost optimization.<br />
- To build a model that finds optimal diets that meet nutritional requirements with the minimum cost.<br />
  
## 4 Algorithms  & Tools Applied
### Linear programming
Linear programming optimizes complex systems and finds cost-effective solutions.<br />
It effectively creates diet plans that meet nutritional requirements while minimizing costs.<br />

### Octave
Octave is an open-source numerical computing package for tracking food expenses and optimizing grocery shopping.<br />
Octave can analyze and adjust spending habits to optimize nutrient balance and budget allocation.
Taking advantage of Octave's resources is a logical choice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle on a budget.

## 5 Modelling
Constrained optimization is used to find the minimum objective function while fulfilling a set of constraints. 

Both objective function and the constraints are in linear form, we are solving a linear programming type of constrained optimization problem.

Our objective is to find out the minimum cost for a healthy diet plan. 40 types of food coming from different food groups are selected to provide a variety of choices for end users. <br />

## 6 Conclusion
A healthy diet plan should vary based on individuals from different age groups, gender, and level of physical activity, instead of producing a one-size-fits-all solution.​<br />

Based on the data gathered, linear programming emerges as the ideal technique for implementing a diet cost optimization model:<br />
- Due to its compatibility with linearly expressed objective functions (minimizing cost)<br />
- Constraints (nutritional requirements, recommended dietary intakes)<br />
- Efficiency and flexibility in handling large-scale problems.​
